# 🔐 Password Strength Analyzer

A simple Python tool that:
- Checks password strength (length, complexity, patterns)
- Suggests improvements
- Uses the [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#PwnedPasswords) API to check if the password has appeared in data breaches (privacy-safe using k-anonymity).

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Strength scoring system (Weak, Medium, Strong)
- ✅ Feedback on how to improve your password
- ✅ Data breach check via HIBP (no raw password ever sent)
